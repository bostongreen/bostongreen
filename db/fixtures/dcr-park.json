In 1750, Welsh immigrant John Adam Dagyr introduced local shoemakers to improved techniques of making high quality women's shoes. By the early 1800s, shoemaking had become a prosperous industry, supplying the nation through nearby maritime ports.

Approximately a quarter of the parkland is decked over the railroad tracks, providing more space for grass and plantings, and such recreational facilities as 11 tot lot areas, 2 spray pools, 7 basketball courts, 5 tennis courts, 2 street hockey rinks, 2 amphitheatres, and approximately six miles of biking, jogging and walking paths. History In the 1950's and 60's, plans were developed for a 12-lane highway along the railroad right of way between Boston and Rte. 128, and on into Cambridge. The residents of the affected areas, including Jamaica Plain, Roxbury, South End, Back Bay, and Cambridge, began community protests and demonstrations against the destruction of their neighborhoods by the planned highway. After hundreds of heated meetings and protests, Governor Sargent scrapped the plans in 1969, and highway funds were used to develop mass transit, open space and recreational facilities. The new, relocated Orange Line and the adjacent Southwest Corridor Park were opened in May, 1987.", "photo_url": "http:\/\/www.mass.gov\/dcr\/parks\/metroboston\/images\/sw-corridor.jpg", "image": "sw-corridor.jpg", "mbta_directions": "Take the Orange line and get off at any stop from Back Bay to Forest Hills.", "feature": "Tot Lot", "activities": "Spray Pools\nBasketball Courts\nTennis Court\nBike Path\nWalking", "ownership": "Department of Conservation and Recreation", "url": "http:\/\/www.mass.gov\/dcr\/parks\/metroboston\/southwestCorr.htm", "friends_url_1": "http:\/\/www.swcpc.org\/", "friends_url_2": "", "more_information": "http:\/\/www.mhd.state.ma.us\/default.asp?pgid=..\/common\/downloads\/bikemaps\/south&sid=about", "report_a_problem": "http:\/\/www.mass.gov\/dcr\/aboutDCR.htm", "googlemap_url": "http:\/\/maps.google.com\/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=Southwest+Corridor,+Boston,+MA&aq=0&sll=42.446942,-70.985702&sspn=0.004228,0.00751&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=Southwest+Corridor,+Boston,+Suffolk,+Massachusetts+02130&ll=42.315956,-71.104546&spn=0.00887,0.01502&t=h&z=16&iwloc=A", "lat": "42.315956", "lon": "-71.104546" }, "geometry": null }
