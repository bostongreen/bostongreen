He served as an aide to Washington during the Revolutionary War, participated in the Continental Congress, signed the Constitution, and was appointed the first Secretary of the Treasury under President Washington. Most importantly, Hamilton helped to secure the future of the new United States by creating a unified economy and a national bank. As an advocate of strong federal government, Hamilton made more than a few enemies among his fellow politicians, including Thomas Jefferson and John Adams. Some ridiculed him as a monarchist, claiming that he intended to impose a strict, centralized rule on the American people. Among Hamilton's many personal and political opponents was Vice President Aaron Burr. After challenging Hamilton to a duel, Burr killed him with a shot to the abdomen. This sculpture by William Rimmer shows Hamilton with cloth draped over his Colonial-era outfit. The heavy folds of drapery bring to mind depictions of Greek and Roman leaders in ancient statuary. Through this anachronistic touch, Rimmer evoked the first democratic-style governments in ancient Greece, thereby emphasizing Hamilton's formative role in the newly emerging American democracy. Interestingly, Rimmer was a physician before devoting himself to art. He did not use a model to create the statue, but instead employed his unique knowledge of human anatomy to chisel Hamilton's body from a block of granite. Due to Rimmer's unusual technique, this sculpture is particularly fragile and difficult to maintain."}}, {"geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": ["42.352284", "-71.126065"]}, "type": "Feature", "id": "3", "properties": {"funders": "Browne Fund", "medium": "Steel and plastic", "neighborhood": "Allston", "name": "Allston Directional", "artist": "Peter Brooks", "collection": "City of Boston", "location": "Packards Corner, Allston", "year": "2005", "type": "Sculpture", "description": "For Allstonians, Packard's Corner is the gateway to Allston.

Cyrus Edwin Dallin depicts Revere on his famous \"midnight ride\" of 1775, alerting his fellow colonists that the British army was moving toward Lexington, MA. Dallin emphasizes the urgency and energy of Revere's mission through the posture of both the horse and its rider. Revere attempts to keep his balance as his horse abruptly halts, rearing back slightly. Dallin's design also seems to recognize the presence of his viewers. Walk over to Revere's right side, and you play the role of a colonist receiving his message. During the 18th and 19th centuries, several myths and misconceptions about Revere's ride came to be accepted as truth. In fact, Revere did not yell \"The British are coming!\" so as not to be overheard by British informants, and he was only one among dozens of riders who spread the message on horseback. His midnight ride was perhaps less important to American independence than the work he did as an engraver. With his widely circulated depictions of the Boston Massacre and other events, Revere helped to incite anger towards the British and sympathy towards the colonists. Despite the myths, Revere has retained his significance as a key symbol of the energy and courage that drove colonists in their fight against imperial rule, and Dallin has placed him in this familiar role. Although Dallin designed this sculpture for a competition in 1885, it was not cast in bronze until 1940. The statue's installation was halted for several years, after another artist assailed Dallin's winning submission, calling it unrealistic.

Outnumbered, many of the troops, including Shaw, were killed and buried in a mass grave by Confederate soldiers. One of the soldiers who survived the assault, William H. Carney, received a Medal of Honor in recognition of his bravery. The 54th also reportedly included Frederick Douglass' two sons and the grandson of abolitionist Sojourner Truth. In the relief, an angel accompanies the men as they march down Beacon Street on May 28, 1863, leaving Boston to head south.

For example, each soldier's face is markedly distinct, endowed with a unique appearance and expression.

When the plantation's owner died, Tubman escaped, following the North Star and stopping at various Underground Railroad 'stations' along the 90-mile journey to Pennsylvania. But Tubman did not remain safely in the North for long. Within a year, she returned to Maryland to help members of her family escape. What began as a plot to reunite her family became a broader mission to free as many people as possible, personal relations as well as strangers. Over the next decade, Tubman took nineteen trips to the South, guiding over 300 individuals to freedom. Although she was illiterate and received no formal education, Tubman became known as one of the most adroit Underground Railroad conductors. A $40,000 reward was posted for her capture. Here, local sculptor Fern Cunningham shows Tubman leading a small group up north. She strides forward confidently, with a Bible tucked under her left arm\u2014a reference to both her religious devotion and her Biblical nickname, Moses. Interestingly, the men and women behind her appear calm and assured. Perhaps their journey is coming to an end, or perhaps their expressions are not literal but symbolic, illustrating the spirit of courage and devotion that drove Tubman on. Although Tubman never lived in Boston, she had links to the city through her network of abolitionist friends, one of whom opened the Harriet Tubman House as a settlement house for black women who had migrated from the South. The house has since relocated, but it still exists today as part of the United South End Settlements program.

This figure is a portrait of Archer Alexander, a former slave who risked his life to notify the Union army that Confederates had sabotaged a railroad bridge over which Union troops were planning to travel. Fearing retribution, Alexander fled. He is believed to be one of the last individuals captured under the Fugitive Slave Act. Sculptor Thomas Ball has been criticized for representing Alexander as kneeling at Lincoln's feet. But others might interpret the work differently and claim that Alexander's posture is not that of a kneeling man but of one rising to claim his new freedom.
